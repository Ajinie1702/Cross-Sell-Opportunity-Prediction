# Project Description: Cross-Sell Opportunity Prediction

## **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting cross-sell opportunities for health insurance customers, particularly aiming to identify individuals who are most likely to purchase vehicle insurance. By leveraging historical data, customer demographics, and insurance purchase behavior, the project seeks to enhance customer lifetime value (CLV) through personalized recommendations. It integrates machine learning models to predict customer interest, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, ultimately driving higher sales and improving overall customer satisfaction.

## **Key Objectives**

**1. Predict Cross-Sell Opportunities for Vehicle Insurance**
  - Leverage customer data, including demographics, policy history, and interactions, to predict the likelihood of existing health insurance customers purchasing vehicle insurance.
  - Build a predictive framework that identifies high-potential cross-sell customers.
  - Utilize machine learning models to generate predictions, enabling personalized product recommendations based on customer behavior and preferences.

**2. Develop and Evaluate Machine Learning Models**
  - Build a comprehensive set of machine learning models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
  - Preprocess and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing data imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
  - Evaluate the models using multiple performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Sensitivity, and Specificity.
  - Compare the performance of these models to determine the most accurate approach for predicting cross-sell opportunities.

**3. Optimize Model Performance and Hyperparameter Tuning**
  - Perform detailed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance, ensuring the best balance between accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
  - Explore feature importance to identify the most influential factors contributing to the cross-sell predictions.
  - Implement cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization of model performance.

**4. Visualize Data and Prediction Insights**
  - Use Power BI to create dynamic and interactive dashboards that visualize key performance metrics, including customer segments, product purchase trends, and predicted cross-sell opportunities.
  - Develop detailed reports to help stakeholders understand the cross-sell potential across different customer demographics, geographic regions, and policy types.
  - Analyze trends and customer behavior to identify actionable insights for enhancing targeted marketing campaigns.

**5. Personalize Customer Recommendations**
  - Implement personalized product recommendations based on model predictions, ensuring that marketing efforts are focused on high-potential customers.
  - Improve the relevance of product offerings by aligning recommendations with customer needs and preferences, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and increased conversion rates.
  - Use the insights gained from model predictions to inform sales teams and marketing strategies for more effective cross-sell initiatives.

## **Tools Used**

  - **Python**: Employed for data preprocessing, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
  - **Pandas, NumPy**: Used for handling and manipulating large datasets efficiently.
  - **Scikit-learn**: Utilized to build and evaluate machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, and Random Forest.
  - **SMOTE**: Applied to handle class imbalance in the dataset, ensuring that minority classes (potential cross-sell customers) are well-represented during training.
  - **Power BI**: Used to create visually compelling, interactive dashboards for displaying model results, customer insights, and performance metrics.
  - **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Employed in Power BI for performing dynamic calculations and creating custom measures for data visualization.
  - **Query Editor**: Utilized for cleaning and transforming raw data, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of inputs for analysis.

## **Outcome**
  - Successfully built and deployed machine learning models to predict cross-sell opportunities, identifying customers most likely to purchase vehicle insurance.
  - Generated valuable insights that enable targeted marketing efforts, improving both sales conversion rates and customer satisfaction through personalized offers.
  - Created comprehensive Power BI dashboards that provide clear visualizations of model performance, prediction accuracy, and customer segmentation.
  - Improved decision-making for marketing and sales teams through data-driven insights, resulting in more efficient allocation of resources towards high-potential customers.
  - Enhanced overall business performance by increasing the lifetime value of health insurance customers through effective cross-sell strategies.
